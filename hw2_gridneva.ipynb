The hue argument adds a color marker to the plots and it will allow us to analyze how customers with different behavior patterns react to the marketing proposals. Note, to use the column as hue, it should be passed with the rest of the columns; also you can pass `kind='scatter', plot_kws=dict(alpha=0.2)` arguments to make the dots semi-transparent.\n",
